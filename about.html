  <h1>AbouT</h1>
    <p>This here is an exploration of our most grievous annoyances: the popup ad. Otherwise known as a scam, blurb, sale, deal, stalker, hacker, weirdo, etc.
        <br>
        <br>

        The purpose of this website is to serve as an experience into another side of popup ads, <span class="redtext">a world where they provide a more calming and freeing experience, one where a user has more choice in how long they see the ad and what they can do with it.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        My ideal user is someone who hates popup ads with every fiber in their being, someone who fantasizes about a world where popup ads were never invented and spends their time cursing those who facilitate them into websites. They should be looking for a way to take out their emotions on an ad, more freedom in their experience, more control in their digital escapades.
<br>
<br>
I made this website because I feel like when I go online these days, so little of my experience is actually my own. Every website I go to, page I flick through, or thing I click on doesn’t feel like my choice at all. It always feels like there may be someone tracking my data, directing me subconsciously, analyzing how long I look at something in order to control where I go next. I don’t often feel comfortable on many corners of the internet these days. I wanted to create a place to just click without real consequence, in fact everytime you click, you rid yourself of the unwanted and unneeded things filling every inch of our scenes. I position myself as everyone’s savior for creating such a piece to save us from the terrors of unwanted popup ads! Just kidding, I view myself as an individual who experiences rage at my online experiences feeling violated and chaotic. I am one of many and in being so, I can bring my experience to the internet in hopes that I can help out just a little bit.
<br>
<br>
I wish it looked better and had more form. At the moment it’s basically a screen with a bunch of images and that feels very basic even though I know the work I put in is anything but. I wish it reflected the visions I have in my head but I don’t feel my coding skills are living up to the hype I have for them in my mind. And that’s a combination of me, my work load, what has to be prioritized (AKA my boring ass astronomy homework because I can’t fail my midterm) but depending on my position in life, my productivity shifts as easily as leaves in the wind.
It’s limited due to my skill set but also I feel my creative capacity, sometimes I just can’t think of good ideas, my mind doesn’t always go there as easily as I wish it would ):
<br>
<br>
The next iteration is something more polished with maybe some more interactivity, something that looks more like a something if that makes sense. Something identifiable, something meaningful, maybe something that may not even need an explanation to be something real.
